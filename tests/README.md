## Tests

There are a bunch of tests in here.

To run them on a shell, use 'runner'. It'll search out the test files
and run them using various versions of python.

If you want to run the tests manually, set your PYTHONPATH to be equal
to the base 'pau' folder (ie. the one *containing* a tests folder, not
the one *inside* the tests folder).

You should then be able to run a test simply by going:

    python pref_tests.py
